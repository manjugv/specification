A set is a group of \ac{PE} either created by the set creation operations defined in this section or is one of the predefined sets. The set creation operations are local operations and do not require communication between the \acp{PE} participating in the creation operation. The set is represented by an opaque object and cannot be passed from one \ac{PE} to another.

The \acp{PE} in the set are identified by a non-negative integer called the set index. The set indices are monotonically increasing and start from zero. If a \ac{PE} participates in the set creation operation but is not a part of the created set, it is identified by a negative integer. This property is useful when querying the membership to a set.

The OpenSHMEM program initialized by either shmem\_init or shmem\_init\_thread creates SHMEM\_SET\_WORLD during the initialization operation. Every \ac{PE} that calls shmem\_init or shmem\_init\_thread is a member of the SHMEM\_SET\_WORLD and its \ac{PE} index in SHMEM\_SET\_WORLD is the same as its global \ac{PE} number as returned by shmem\_my\_pe. The SHMEM\_SET\_WORLD is a valid set after return from the shmem\_init or shmem\_init\_thread. This set can be referenced in the program by the constant SHMEM\_SET\_WORLD.
