\apidescription{
The shmem\_group\_free routine invalidates the existing group handle and releases all resources associated with the group. This is a collective operation, in which every member of the group being destroyed needs to participate. On return, the group handle is set to SHMEM\_GROUP\_NULL, after which it can no longer be used for collective operations.

\apireturnvalues{
shmem\_group\_free  returns 0 upon success; otherwise, it returns a non-zero value
