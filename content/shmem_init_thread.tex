\apidescription{
    \FUNC{shmem\_thread\_init}  initializes the \openshmem{} library similar to
    \FUNC{shmem\_init}, and in addition perform the initialization required for
    thread-safe invocation of \openshmem{} functions. The argument
    \textit{requested} is used to specify the desired level of thread support.
    The function returns the support provided by the library. There are three 
    levels of threading support.
 
 \begin{itemize}
\item SHMEM\_THREAD\_SINGLE: The \openshmem{} program may not be multithreaded, 
and all \openshmem{} interfaces are invoked by a single thread. 

\item SHMEM\_THREAD\_FUNNELED: 
The \openshmem{} program may be multithreaded, however, the 
program must ensure that only one thread invokes the \openshmem{}
interfaces.

\item SHMEM\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE: 
The \openshmem{} program may be multithreaded, and any 
thread may invoke the \openshmem{} interfaces.
 
\end{itemize}

The function may be used to initialize \openshmem{}, and to initialize the
\openshmem{} with thread safety, instead of SHMEM\_INIT. The SHMEM\_INIT\_THREAD
may not be called multiple times in an \openshmem{} program.
}

\apireturnvalues{    
	NONE
    }

\apinotes{
The \openshmem{} programming model does not recognize individual threads.  Any
\openshmem{} operation initiated by a thread is considered an action of the
process as a whole. Thread-safety should not be activated unless needed.
Activating  thread-safety causes additional overhead even if no additional
threads are created or used.
